AirBnB projecr
that is a new full web project
sliced into small chuncks
to start with the console, then we'll see what's next!

The command interpreter is supposed to handle input from the user whether through
an inreactive or non-interactive session!
It's limited to a specific use-case
It's supposed to be able to manage the objects of the project (creation, retrieval, doing operations [counting, computing states ...], updating the obj.'s attributes and lastly destroying the objects)
